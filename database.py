//what operations will I have with my db?
// Saving photo 
// saving post text
// saving date, time, and duration
// saving pdf file of kaspi check
// there will be NO update button, so if client wants to change something AFTER he accepted, he would need to cancel it and create a new one with the fixed whatever. When it comes to payment, he would just send the same kaspi pdf check file and that`s it.
// The only question that arise is related to cancelation of payment. How will the money be returned
